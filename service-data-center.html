                    <h2>Our Comprehensive Data Center Services</h2>
                    <p>A modern data center is the heart of your IT operations. CloudPros provides a full spectrum of services to ensure your physical infrastructure is robust, resilient, and ready to meet the demands of your business. We handle every aspect of the data center lifecycle.</p>
                    
                    <h3>IT Data Center Build</h3>
                    <p>We manage greenfield data center projects from the ground up, including site selection, architectural design, and construction, ensuring the final facility meets industry best practices and your specific operational requirements.</p>

                    <h3>Environmental Monitoring System (EMS)</h3>
                    <p>Protect your critical hardware with a state-of-the-art EMS. We deploy sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, airflow, water leaks, and power usage, providing real-time alerts to prevent environmental threats from causing downtime.</p>

                    <h3>Fire Fighting System</h3>
                    <p>Safety is paramount. We install advanced fire suppression systems, such as clean agent (FM-200, Novec 1230) solutions, that extinguish fires quickly without damaging sensitive electronic equipment, ensuring business continuity.</p>

                    <h3>Air Precision Cooling System</h3>
                    <p>High-density computing requires specialized cooling. We design and install Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) and Air Handling (CRAH) units to maintain precise temperature and humidity levels, guaranteeing optimal performance and longevity of your servers.</p>

                    <h3>UPS & Power Solutions</h3>
                    <p>Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) systems are critical for uptime. We provide and configure robust UPS solutions, generators, and power distribution units (PDUs) to deliver clean, consistent power and protect against outages.</p>

                    <h3>High Availability (HA) Design</h3>
                    <p>We architect your power and network infrastructure for maximum resilience. Using N+1 or 2N redundancy models, we eliminate single points of failure, ensuring your services remain online even during component failures or maintenance.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Raised Floor Services</h3>
                    <p>A raised floor is foundational for cable management and optimized airflow. We install durable, accessible raised flooring systems that create an underfloor plenum for efficient cooling and provide a hidden, organized pathway for power and data cables.</p>

                    <h3>On-Premise Server & Backup Solution</h3>
                    <p>We deploy and configure server racks, high-performance servers, and robust backup solutions within your data center. This includes setting up network-attached storage (NAS), storage area networks (SAN), and automated backup software to protect your critical data.</p>
